Now, the leading developers have begun to pass the added costs on to buyers, in some cases by up to 10% of the price of a house, and they are not reporting any adverse effect on sales. \r\nMumbai, the ‘City of dreams,’ is living up to its name. It continues to fulfil dreams and aspirations of people migrating to the city in search of jobs and entrepreneurial ambitions. The city with its developed infrastructure, easy connectivity and access to public amenities makes it an ideal location for migrants to settle down.\r\nProperty registrations in Mumbai, the country’s biggest real estate market, have continued to reflect robust momentum in February, surpassing the pre-pandemic levels witnessed two years ago by a wide margin.\r\nMumbai, apart from being the country’s largest realty market, is now also one of the strongest growth markets. A slew of measures like the progressive budget, availability of the lowest home loans rates and a good homebuying environment is driving this growth. We expect this uptrend to continue in the months to come and hope that the government remains supportive,\r\nThe Mumbai property market has been buzzing with activity since the state government announced a reduction in stamp duty rates in 2020 to kickstart the realty sector and other industries linked with it.",
